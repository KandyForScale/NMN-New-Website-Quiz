It might seem a bit strange that you’d need anti-aging supplements so early on in your life, but the peak of your hormones and energy is at 25, and sadly it’s all downhill from there. If you fall into this age category, you might have already experienced a lack of energy and productivity. But thankfully, we have engineered a way to keep longevity in your grasp with our supplements. Customers that have taken NMN have almost instantly reported an increase in energy and focus, and these supplements have been scientifically proven to fight symptoms of aging and cell degradation. And TMG boosts these effects even more. So, if you are over 25 years old, do not hesitate until you start feeling the heavy effects of aging - turn the tables and take care of your body as early on as possible.<\/p>",

        "text1": "<p>NMN is a direct precursor of NAD+, and it has been proven to boost NAD+ levels in animals and humans, due to high absorption from the cells. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, commonly known as NAD+, is a molecule that is found in every living cell and is a master regulator of human metabolism. It’s a molecule essential for multiple biological processes and is also used by the genes governing the aging process named SIRTUINS. Without NAD+, cells cannot survive. As we age, the levels of NAD+ are reducing, something that affects mitochondrial function, energy production and as a result, a plethora of vital cellular functions. NAD+ boosters are one of the most promising anti-aging breakthroughs from scientific research so far.<\/p>",
        "title2": "The Scientific Background",
        "text2": "<p>NAD was discovered over a hundred years ago by scientists studying fermentation. It’s levels have been shown to decline during chronological aging and this decline is both a consequence of the aging process and also a contributor to the development of age-related cellular dysfunction. NAD+ plays a vital role in cellular health, metabolic and neuro-protection plus circadian rhythms which can all contribute to greater longevity. This is the reason why so many people are keen to boost their NAD+ levels.<\/p>"

One of the precursors for NAD+ is beta nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN. NMN is a Vitamin B3 (niacin) derivative. Put simply, NMN increases NAD+, activates the longevity genes SIRTUINS and suppresses aging. NMN has gained a lot of attention recently,especially after the release of longevity scientist, David Sinclair’s book Lifespan. In his book, the scientist discusses his research examining NMN, particularly in mice.<\/p>",

However, as the concentrations are less than 1 mg per kg of food you would need to consume about 1kg of broccoli to get about 1mg of NMN! Therefore, you need a supplement to get an optimum level of NMN.<\/p>"
