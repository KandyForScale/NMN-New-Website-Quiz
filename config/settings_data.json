That’s the reason most adults start experiencing increased fatigue at this age, sleeping less than they did in their early twenties and their sex drive and focus is on a steady decline.

This is because its role in the biological process of ageing is being recognized.  NAD levels have been shown to decline during chronological ageing and this decline is both a consequence of the ageing process and also a contributor to the development of age-related cellular dysfunction.<\/p><p>NAD+ plays a vital role in cellular health, metabolic and neuro-protection plus circadian rhythms which can all contribute to greater longevity. This is the reasons why so many people are keen to boost their NAD+ levels. <\/p><p>A decrease in NAD+ can a lead to a number of harmful outcomes including:<\/p><p>·     Increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer<\/p><p>·     Cell suffocation (Hypoxia)<\/p><p>·     Accelerated cardiovascular disease<\/p><p>·     Decreased metabolism<\/p><p>·     Impaired brain function<\/p><p><strong>What is Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)?<\/strong><\/p><p>As our cells can’t absorb NAD+ directly we need to use a “precursor”, which is a molecule that converts into NAD+. One of the precursors for NAD+ is beta nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN<strong>. <\/strong>NMN is a Vitamin B3 (niacin) derivative. Put simply, NMN increases NAD+, activates the longevity genes SIRTUINS and suppresses ageing.<\/p><p>NMN has gained a lot of attention recently,especially after the release of longevity scientist, David Sinclair’s book <em>Lifespan<\/em>. In his book, the scientist discusses his research examining NMN, particularly in mice.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Can I get NMN from food?<\/strong><\/p><p>NMN can be found naturally in foods such as broccoli, cabbage, avocados and tomatoes. However, as the concentrations are less than 1 mg per kg of food you would need to consume about 1kg of broccoli to get about 1mg of NMN! Therefore, you need a supplement to get an optimum level of NMN. <\/p>",

This translates to inevitable health and energy decline. The reason behind this is the consumption of NAD+ by multiple NADases, aka enzymes that use NAD+ to function and perform biological reactions. Certain enzymes such as PARPs and CD38, have increased activity as we age, due to their reaction to inflammation, DNA damage etc. They are competing for NAD+ with SIRTUINS, which are the genes that are suggested to correlate with healthy aging. <\/p><p>This latest research is the reason behind the NAD+ boosting supplements becoming more and more popular among longevity enthusiasts and wellness specialists. It is worth noting that Nicotinamide Mononucleotide is a direct precursor to NAD+, meaning that it enters the cell and is converted to NAD+ in one step. Other NAD+ boosters require more steps in order to be converted to NAD+. For example, Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) needs to be converted to NMN first before it can boost your NAD+ levels. <br\/><br\/><\/p>",

Do you feel the same? Do you feel worse? Do you feel better?  When you eat a proper meal you should feel good and energetic. <br\/>It will take trial and error to find the right foods that always deliver a positive, energetic result.  After you have found the right diet, remember to not overeat and stick with the diet that makes you feel the best. As a rule of thumb, processed foods are usually the ones you should limit or eliminate from your diet, in order to feel better after consuming a meal.<br\/><br\/><strong>Solution 2 - Sleep <br\/><\/strong><br\/>We are still amazed how many people don’t take their sleep seriously. The human body needs at least 7-8 hours of sleep, which means you need to spend about 30% of your life sleeping.<\/p><p>Optimizing sleep your sleep schedule is one of the best pieces of advice for maintaining great energy levels and even increasing happiness.<br\/><br\/><strong>Let's talk about the following points in more detail.<br\/><br\/><\/strong>·   Sleeping position and mattress softness.<\/p><p>·   Not eating 3-4 hours before bed.<\/p><p>·   How to prepare for sleep.<\/p><p>·   Tips to overcome problems falling asleep.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>Sleeping position and mattress softness.<\/strong><\/p><p>If you are a belly sleeper - choose a soft mattress.<br\/><br\/>If you are side sleeper - choose medium mattress<\/p><p>If you are back sleeper - choose hard mattress<\/p><p>Mattresses are a personal choice, but too many people sleep on poor quality mattresses and don't get the good rest they deserve.<br\/><br\/><strong>Don’t eat a big meal 3-4 hours before bed.<br\/><br\/><\/strong>A simple rule that many of us tend to forget.<br\/><br\/><strong>How to prepare for sleep.<br\/><br\/><\/strong>·   Reduce blue light exposure in the evening.<\/p><p>·   Don’t consume caffeine after 4pm.<\/p><p>·   Make sure your bedroom is a quiet, relaxing, clean, and an enjoyable place.<\/p><p>·   Test different room temperatures to find out which is most comfortable for you. Around 70°F (20°C) is best for most people.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>Having problems falling asleep?<br\/><br\/><\/strong>Falling asleep is something a lot of people have trouble with.  There are many things that can help remedy this problem, but the best advice is to calm your mind.  A restless mind can keep you from falling asleep, since your mind is still busy working away.  Most of the time you worry about things and that in turn creates stress.   <\/p><p><\/p><p>To solve this you must  learn how to meditate or clear your mind.  Meditation will help you to calm your mind and you will fall asleep faster.  A lot of people depend on sleeping pills to get the rest they need,  but there is nothing better than natural sleep with a clear mind.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>Solution 3 - Stress management<\/strong><\/p><p><\/p><p>Are you stressed and anxious all the time?  Work, daily life, responsibilities, and the people around you can all contribute to stress and anxiety.  When life goes bad, how do you deal with stress and anxiety?<br\/><br\/>A lot of people turn to alcohol and sugar, but that’s a short term solution with harsh consequences.<br\/><br\/><strong>How should you deal with stress?<br\/><br\/><\/strong>·   Eliminate foods that stress your digestive system.<\/p><p>·   Eliminate negative people around you and keep your attention focussed on the positive.<\/p><p>·   When feeling bad or lost, meditate to calm your mind and think of alternative solutions to the problem you are stuck in at the moment.<br\/><br\/>Meditation works by calming your mind.  It’s important to stay in the present and not dwell on perceived future worries.  There is no future, there is only the present.  A lot of problems we worry about don’t ever happen or are not of much consequence if and when they do happen..  Meditation helps to calm your mind.  A calm mind = a calm body =  much great energy and happiness.<br\/><br\/><strong>Solution 4 - Smart supplements (advanced)<br\/><br\/><\/strong>There are a lot of different supplements on the market, but how do you know which one works?  The problem is that 95% of the supplements on the market are not made by scientists.  Researching and developing scientific based supplements is very hard and a lot of companies skip the research to take supplements directly to market.<\/p><p><\/p><p>We have found a few supplements we take daily which help tremendously with energy.   Food can provide the most basic nutrients like vitamins and minerals, but there are a lot of other useful things out there you can supplement your diet with to get the most energy.<br\/><br\/><strong>L-theanine with green tea extract<br\/><br\/><\/strong>Most known for helping people relax, L-theanine has other potential health benefits, including: <\/p><p><\/p><p>·   Anxiety and stress relief<\/p><p>·   Increased focus<\/p><p>·   Better immunity<\/p><p>·   Tumor and cancer treatment<\/p><p>·   Blood pressure management<br\/><br\/><strong>Caffeine<br\/><br\/><\/strong>Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages.  Thanks to its high levels of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients, it also seems to be quite healthy.  Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of several serious diseases.<\/p><p>·   Can Improve Reaction Times<\/p><p>·   Just don't drink it too much.<\/p><p>·   Contains Essential Nutrients (Vitamin B2, B3, B5, potassium)<\/p><p>·   Can Drastically Improve Physical Performance<\/p><p>·   Can Help You Burn Fat<\/p><p>·   Can Improve Reaction Times<br\/><br\/>·   Just don't drink it too much.<br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>Magnesium<br\/><br\/><\/strong>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body.  It plays several important roles in the health of your body and brain.  However, you may not be getting enough of it, even if you eat a healthy diet. Magnesium is  involved in more than 600 reactions in your body, including:<br\/><br\/>·   Energy creation: Helps convert food into energy.<\/p><p>·   Protein formation: Helps create new proteins from amino acids.<\/p><p>·   Gene maintenance: Helps create and repair DNA and RNA.<\/p><p>·   Muscle movements: Is part of the contraction and relaxation of muscles.<\/p><p>·   Nervous system regulation: Helps regulate neurotransmitters, which send messages throughout your brain and nervous system.<br\/><br\/>The best types of magnesium to try out is glycinate (or biglycinate) or threonate.<br\/><br\/><strong>The benefits of magnesium<br\/><\/strong><br\/>·   May Boost Exercise Performance<br\/><br\/>·   Can Help to Fight Depression<\/p><p>·   Benefits Against Type 2 Diabetes<\/p><p>·   Can Lower Blood Pressure<\/p><p>·   Has Anti-Inflammatory Benefits<\/p><p>·   Can Help Prevent Migraines<\/p><p>·   Reduces Insulin Resistance<\/p><p>·   Improves PMS Symptoms<\/p><p>·   Safe and Widely Available<br\/><br\/><strong>NMN | (beta Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) <br\/><\/strong>Without NAD+, cells cannot survive.<br\/><br\/>As we age, the levels of NAD+ reduce, something that affects mitochondrial function, energy production and as a result a plethora of vital cellular functions.<br\/><br\/>NAD+ boosters are one of the most promising anti-ageing breakthroughs from scientific research so far.<br\/><br\/>Every year Americans spend billions of dollars on anti-aging products. <br\/><br\/>Most anti-aging products try to reverse the signs of aging on your skin.  <br\/>NMN (beta Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) aims to reverse signs of aging from the inside out. <br\/><br\/>Within your body, nicotinamide riboside is converted into NAD+, a helper molecule that exists inside each of your cells and supports many aspects of healthy aging.<br\/><br\/><strong>How does NMN work?<br\/><\/strong><br\/>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, commonly known as NAD+, is a molecule that is found in every living cell and is a master regulator of human metabolism.<br\/><br\/>It's a molecule essential for multiple biological processes and is also used by the genes governing the aging process named SIRTUINS.<br\/><br\/>Without NAD+, cells cannot survive. As we age, the levels of NAD+ are reducing, something that affects mitochondrial function, energy production and as a result, a plethora of vital cellular functions.<br\/><br\/><strong>A decrease in NAD+ can a lead to a number of harmful outcomes including:<br\/><br\/><\/strong>·     Increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer<br\/><br\/>·     Cell suffocation (Hypoxia)<\/p><p>·     Accelerated cardiovascular disease<\/p><p>·     Decreased metabolism<\/p><p>·     Impaired brain function<br\/><br\/><strong>What is Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)?<br\/><br\/><\/strong>As our cells can’t absorb NAD+ directly we need to use a “precursor”, which is a molecule that converts into NAD+. One of the precursors for NAD+ is beta nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN. NMN is a Vitamin B3 (niacin) derivative. Put simply, NMN increases NAD+, activates the longevity genes SIRTUINS and suppresses ageing.<br\/><br\/>NMN has gained a lot of attention recently,especially after the release of longevity scientist, David Sinclair’s book Lifespan. In his book, the scientist discusses his research examining NMN, particularly in mice.<br\/><br\/><strong>Can I get NMN from food?<br\/><br\/><\/strong>NMN can be found naturally in foods such as broccoli, cabbage, avocados and tomatoes. However, as the concentrations are less than 1 mg per kg of food you would need to consume about 1kg of broccoli to get about 1mg of NMN! Therefore, you need a supplement to get an optimum level of NMN.<br\/><br\/><strong>What does it feel like after you start taking NMN? <\/strong><\/p><p>Day 1 - NMN starts working towards restoring your NAD+ levels that are essential for energy production.<\/p><p>Day 2-3 - You might start noticing a difference in energy levels and focus. Dreams usually start becoming more vivid, as your deep sleep is improved.<\/p><p>Day 7 - You realise that it’s late evening but you are not as  tired as usual.<\/p><p>Day 14 - Focus, concentration, and physical well-being are notably different. You get more done during the day. No need for an afternoon nap. <\/p><p>Day 21 - You might start noticing that your sugar craving has decreased.<br\/><br\/><strong>How and when should I take NMN?<\/strong><\/p><p>You should take it before breakfast to increase its absorption.<br\/><br\/>If you're younger than 35, you can start with 250mg a day and after 1-2 weeks increase to 500 mg to see which works better for you.  If you're older than 35, start with 500mg a day, then increase to 1g to see which works better for you.<br\/><br\/><strong>Is it safe?<br\/><\/strong><br\/>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide is safe with few  if any side effects. Some people have reported mild to moderate side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, headaches, diarrhea, stomach discomfort and indigestion.  However, these side effects are very rare and unlikely to happen to you.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In human studies, taking 1,000–2,000 mg per day had no harmful effects.  In animals, taking 300 mg per kg of body weight (136 mg per pound) daily for 90 days had no harmful effects.<br\/><br\/><strong>Where Can I find NMN?<br\/><\/strong><br\/>We couldn’t find the high purity, third-party tested NMN we wanted to take and after taking NMN for a short time, we knew right away we wanted to keep taking NMN. <br\/><br\/>It provided us so much more energy and a clear head throughout the day.<br\/><br\/>However, we couldn't find a reliable NMN brand with top quality products.<br\/><br\/>That’s how NMN Bio was born.  <br\/><br\/>Our goal is to provide the best NMN on the market.  <br\/><br\/>We are careful about what we put in our bodies  and we believe you should be too.  <br\/><br\/>Supplements should make you feel better and make your body perform at it’s best. <br\/><br\/>A good  supplement doesn’t have any additional unnecessary ingredients that your body doesn’t need.<\/p><p><strong>Try our NMN here:<\/strong><\/p>"

              "par": "<p>Aging is something that all of us would like to stop in it's tracks. The main causes of aging include cellular damage caused by reactive molecules also known as free radicals and the shortening of telomere which are located at the end of chromosomes and play an important part in cellular division.<br\/>While we can’t stop aging all together, there are steps we can take to slow the process and supplements that have anti-aging effects. Here are a few ways that you can show those wrinkles and loss of energy who is boss.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>1. Exercise<\/strong><br\/>Did you know that less that one fifth of Americans exercise as much as they are suppose too? In case you’re wondering, you are supposed to exercise everyday. The human body evolved to chase down our meals, not eat them while we watch TV on the couch.<br\/>Thirty minutes of daily vigorous exercise is recommended as the bare minimum to keep our bodies in peak condition. This means reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and drastically reducing the amount of stress in your body. So get off that couch and make sure to elevate your heart rate everyday. This can be as simple as going for a walk everyday after dinner. You’ll feel better and you’ll live longer.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>2. Fasting<\/strong><br\/>Not many people realize the true benefits of fasting. Fasting can effect your body right down to the way your cells function, as well as gene expression. While it can help you lose weight, more importantly it can help you live a longer and healthier life.<br\/>A few benefits of fasting include, lowering levels of insulin in the blood and increasing fat burning, increasing your levels of human growth hormone which facilitates muscle growth, and cellular repair which removes waste material from cells.<br\/>You don’t have to fast for days on end either. Fasting during certain hours of the day or a couple days a week can help you to live a better life while pushing back those effects of aging.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>3. Sleep<\/strong><br\/>This is a big one! Did you know most people are not getting enough sleep? It’s true and the downside to your late night work sessions are major. Sleep is just as important as exercise and diet to maintain health as well as slow the effects of aging.<br\/>Research has shown that poor sleep has immediate negative effects on your hormones, physical performance, and brain function. Not to mention, it can cause weight gain and increase your risk of heart disease. So do yourself a favor and get at least seven to eight hours of sleep every night, your body will thank you in the morning<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>4. Morning Journaling<\/strong><br\/>How does morning journaling help you stop the effects of aging? Well research has shown that keeping track of your moods throughout the day, your anxiety, and what causes you stress is an effective tool to help you deal with them in a positive way. It allows you to indentify what triggers your stress thoughout the day and come up with ways to feel better. I guess the pen is mightier than the sword.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>5. Social Media Scrolling<\/strong><br\/>Ok folks this is a big one. Time to put down those screens and unplug from social media. While social media can be used to help us connect with others, it also can have a negative impact on our mental and physical health. Recent research has shown that overuse of social media can cause, low self esteem, increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, anxiety or depression, and even disrupt your sleeping patterns.<br\/>As we’ve learned, if you want to stop the effects of aging, reducing your daily stress and increasing the number of hours you get quality sleep each night are vital. So just say no to endless scrolling and use that time to get in that much needed daily exercise or sleep.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>6. Hydrate First Thing in the Morning<\/strong><br\/>This might seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many people wake up dehydrated and continue their day that way. After sleeping for seven to eight hours your body needs more water to function at it’s best, and that’s not even taking into account the wine or beer you might have drank the night before.<br\/>Two cups of water in the morning is recommended to keep you in optimal condition. This will flush your body of any toxins, keep you hydrated, and jump start your metabolism.<br\/><br\/>___<br\/><strong>7. NMN Bio<\/strong><br\/>Not all supplements are created equal, literally. Not only do you have to be cautious of what supplements can do to your body, but you also want a supplement that is pure and manufactured by a reputable company. Which brings us to NMN Bio.<br\/>So what is Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)? Put simply, NMN increases NAD+, activates the longevity genes SIRTUINS and suppresses ageing. As our cells can’t absorb NAD+ directly we need to use a “precursor”, which is a molecule that converts into NAD+. One of the precursors for NAD+ is beta nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN<strong>. <\/strong>NMN is a Vitamin B3 (niacin) derivative.<br\/><br\/>NMN has gained a lot of attention recently,especially after the release of longevity scientist, David Sinclair’s book <em>Lifespan<\/em>. In his book, the scientist discusses his research examining NMN, particularly in mice.<br\/><br\/>Can you get NMN from food? NMN can be found naturally in foods such as broccoli, cabbage, avocados and tomatoes. However, as the concentrations are less than 1 mg per kg of food you would need to consume about 1kg of broccoli to get about 1mg of NMN! Therefore, you need a supplement to get an optimum level of NMN.<\/p><p><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>"

One of the precursors for NAD+ is beta nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN. NMN is a Vitamin B3 (niacin) derivative. Put simply, NMN increases NAD+, activates the longevity genes SIRTUINS and suppresses aging. NMN has gained a lot of attention recently,especially after the release of longevity scientist, David Sinclair’s book Lifespan. In his book, the scientist discusses his research examining NMN, particularly in mice.<\/p>"

To ensure optimal methylation (as NMN utilises methyl groups to work its magic in your body), you can eventually (in 3-6 weeks) increase the ratio to 1:2, meaning that for each 500mg of NMN, you would need 1g of TMG. If you are supplementing with NMN for a long time already, you can start with 1:2 ratio, and then increase the ratio to 1:3 (1g of NMN to be taken with 3g of TMG).
